* __High-throughput__ __single cell__ RNA/Genome/Exome sequencing
* __GemCode Technology__: Single cells, reagents and a single Gel Bead with barcoded oligonucleotides are encapsulated into nanoliter-sized GEMs (Gel Bead in emulsion)
* Major applications: Individual cell type profiling, differential expression, cell trajectories,..

Two main approaches: (1) Single cell profiling and (2) Genome/Exome sequencing
